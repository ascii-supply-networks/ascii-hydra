# Contribution & Community Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ASCII Hydra project!
Our goal is to create a cost-efficient, vendor-agnostic framework for creating Spark-based assets that run on local PySpark, Databricks, or AWS EMR.
We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and community members who share our vision.
Please follow these guidelines to help maintain a clean, efficient, and collaborative project.
We welcome community contributions to code and to docs, issue, and bug reports, questions, feature requests all on GitHub.

## How to Contribute
1. Start a Discussion
Before forking the repository, please open an issue in our GitHub Issues section to discuss your proposed change—whether it's a bug fix or a new feature. 
This initial discussion helps us:

- Confirm that your idea is aligned with the project's goals.
- Coordinate efforts and avoid duplicate work.
- Gather feedback from maintainers and the community.

Please label your issue appropriately (e.g., bug or enhancement) and include as much detail as possible.

2. Fork and Clone
Once you’ve initiated the discussion and received initial feedback:

Fork the repository on GitHub.
Clone your fork locally:
```bash
Copy
git clone git@github.com:your-username/hydra.git
cd hydra
```
3. Make Your Changes
- Create a Feature Branch:
Start a new branch from the latest main branch (e.g., feature/my-new-feature).
- Implement Your Changes:
Modify the code, add new assets, or update documentation as needed.
- Follow Coding Standards:
Ensure that your changes meet standard style guidelines and best practices. 
We use ruff so please ensure you run `make fmt` and `make lint` and it matches our syle. 
- Before submitting your pull request, make sure all tests pass running `make test`. And add test accordingly for new code 

## Community Guidelines

We strive for an inclusive and respectful environment.
Please communicate courteously and constructively.
- Constructive Feedback:
Engage in discussions and provide clear, actionable feedback.
Focus on the idea and the solution rather than personal opinions.

Clear documentation helps maintain project usability and transparency.
